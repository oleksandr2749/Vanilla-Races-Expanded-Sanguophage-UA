  <VRE_Strigoi.description>The Strigoi were born out of a catastrophic experiment gone awry. A brilliant scientist sought to create the ultimate soldier by merging the DNA of humans and a now-extinct bat-like creature known as the Desmodus. In pursuit of immortality and power, scientist infused these hybrid beings with archites, rendering them deathless and ageless. The Strigoi possess a terrifying visage, with features reminiscent of both humans and bats. Their bodies are covered in a layer of viscous fluid that enhances their ability to heal from any injury, rendering them immune to disease and poison. In battle, the Strigoi are formidable opponents, using their massive talons to tear their enemies apart with ruthless efficiency.\n\nOver the millennia, the Strigoi have been both feared and hunted for their unnatural abilities and the threat they pose to the balance of power in the universe. They have been forced to live in the shadows, hiding from those who would destroy them, yet ever seeking to expand their influence and further their own mysterious agenda.\n\nSome believe that the Strigoi are nothing more than myths and legends, while others whisper of secret cabals of Strigoi controlling entire civilizations from behind the scenes. There are tales of Strigoi orchestrating brutal blood feuds in the darkest corners of the distant planets, or lurking within the shadows of massive space stations, manipulating events to suit their inscrutable purposes.</VRE_Strigoi.description>

  <VRE_Ekkimian.description>In the darkest reaches of the universe, the Ekkimian vampires were birthed from the twisted ambitions of a rogue scientist named Dr. Mortis. Obsessed with the concept of death and resurrection, Dr. Mortis sought to create a new breed of immortals by fusing archites with the DNA of humans and a mysterious, long-extinct species that thrived on consuming the dead. The Ekkimian vampires, as they came to be known, are grotesque and horrifying in appearance. Resembling desiccated corpses more than living beings, their monstrous visages instill terror in all who lay eyes upon them. Despite their hideous appearance, the Ekkimian vampires possess incredible regenerative abilities, healing any injury and remaining immune to disease and poison.\n\nEkkimian vampires must consume hemogen derived exclusively from human corpses to survive. This morbid requirement has led them to lurk in the shadows, scavenging the remains of fallen warriors and feeding on the aftermath of battles. Like other sanguophages, they must periodically enter deathrest to recover their strength and replenish their hemogen reserves.\n\nThere are whispered tales of entire planets falling under the sway of Ekkimian vampire lords, who feed on the corpses of their enemies and rule with an iron, undead fist. Fearful of the day when these monstrous beings might rise up and unleash their full power, the inhabitants of the colonized planets must remain ever vigilant, lest they become mere fodder for the insatiable hunger of the Ekkimians.</VRE_Ekkimian.description>
