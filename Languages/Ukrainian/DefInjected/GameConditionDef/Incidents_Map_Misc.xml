  <VRE_BloodMoonCondition.letterText>One of the moons of this planet has orbited into the rimworld’s umbra, blocking all direct sunlight from illuminating the moon’s surface. This resulted in the moon taking on a crimson color - a phenomena known as the blood moon.\n\nDuring this time, sanguophage mechanites will go into overdrive, driving hemogen-starved bloodfeeders out of their caves. Any bloodfeeder sanguophage with more than half hemogen supply gone will enter the hemohunter mental state. Hemogen will drain significantly quicker during blood moon.</VRE_BloodMoonCondition.letterText>
