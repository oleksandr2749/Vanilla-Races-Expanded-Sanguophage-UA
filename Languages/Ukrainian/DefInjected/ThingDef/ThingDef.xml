Bound to their Draincasket, the occupant's survival depends on being fed regularly, as they can still starve to death.\n\nProduces 2 hemogen packs a day as long as the occupant has food and the casket is connected to a hemogen network. If deprived of food, the casket will kill its occupant in around 2 days.\n\nIf you have Vanilla Nutrient Paste Expanded it will draw nutrients from that network, as long as there is more than 1 meal unit available.-->

  <!--invocation matrix-->
  <VRE_InvocationMatrix.label>матриця виклику</VRE_InvocationMatrix.label>
  <!--A sophisticated device that infuses deathresting people with rare and potent sanguophage abilities, tapping into the very essence of their vampiric nature. Employing a complex system of blood conduits and essence resonators, the matrix connects to a deathrest casket and channels the life force of its occupant to unlock hidden potential within their bloodline. As the person slumbers in their deathrest state, the Invocation Matrix bestows upon them a selected, unique power. This building requires a constant supply of hemogen to operate.-->
